# Web Application Project
This project is a full-stack web application that facilitates the manipulation and viewing of a database using a JSON-based communication protocol. It features CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, along with a CSV-to-JSON converter. The server serves web pages, while the client consists of multiple web pages that interact with the server through AJAX requests for seamless, asynchronous data updates.

# Features
Database Manipulation: Perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database through a JSON-based API.
CSV to JSON Conversion: Convert CSV files into JSON format for easier manipulation and storage.
AJAX-Based Client-Server Communication: AJAX is used for asynchronous requests, allowing updates to the data on the client side without refreshing the page.
Server-Side Web Serving: The server handles serving HTML pages and processing requests.
Client-Side Webpages: A simple client with three main webpages designed for interacting with the server.
